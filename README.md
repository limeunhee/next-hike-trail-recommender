# Next Hike

## A Content based trail recommender

Hiking is a good way to exercise and spend time with friends and family, while also enjoying the surrounding nature. Hikers often rely on various trail websites to gain information about different trails and decide on which new trails to hike on. While some of these websites provide trail recommendations they are largely based on geographic location of the hike they are currently viewing. While this is a very useful feature for people hoping to find nearby trails, some user's also want to get recommendations on trails that might not be in the closet vicinity. Currently, for users who wish to find trails farther away, it is still up to the users to user search or filtering functions to look through various trails and make decision on which one to take on next. 

The goal of this project is to:
 1. Build a trail recommender that takes userâ€™s favorite trail as an input and recommend top 5 trails that are similar to the user input
 2. Build a collaborative filtering based recommender that looks at user's previous ratings on trails and provides personalized recommendations

The recommendated trails are limited to be within the same state as user input, as trails too far away (i.e East Coast) would be less relevant and not practical. Here, we have used trails from CA for recommender, and the framework can be easily adopted and extended to other states.


## The data
### Data source
- The data was scraped from Alltrails.com using AWS, Selenium and beautiful soup
- Total of 1000 trails in CA were scraped that included 400k ratings from 200k unique users. 
- Features for each trail consisted of trail stats (i.e. distance, elevation, difficulty, star rating) as well as descriptive texts (i.e tags, short and long descriptions)

## EDA

Trail stats(i.e elevations, duration, distance) are highly right skewed distritubtion, where majority of trails have short distance/duration/elevations and few trails have long distance/duration/elevations.

From exploring the ratings data, it shows that very few users have average rating 3 or below. Majority of the users have given average rating of 4 or above. Similarly, most of the trails had average rating between 4-5 stars. From number of reviews vs trails plot, we see the typical long tail plot where there are very few items that has large number of reviews, and majority of items having very small number of reviews. However, the area under the two sections can be similar.

 Content based recommender is a recommender system that is built on the item (i.e trail) information only. For example, if a user liked trail A, the recommender finds other trails that are similar to trail A based on information it has on all the trails. Then it generates a list of top n trails for the user. CB is easy to scale as it doesn't require user profiles, however, gives same recommendation regardless of user's personal taste. 
 
 Collaborative filtering based recommender is built on both user and item information. For example, if a user A liked trail A, and users B and C also liked trail A, trails that are liked by users B and C are recommended to user A. CF can give personalized recommendation based on individual user's taste, however it requires large data set with high sparsity and computation can be costly. 


## Content based model
  When a user likes a trail, it could be for the trail stats (certain user likes hike that is less than 3 miles with difficulty level easy) or for other features of the trail such as scenary, dog/family friendliness, whether the trail is paved or not, etc. In order to make suggestions that are based on both the stats and descriptions, two similarity matrices were calculated. Trail stats (distance/duration/eleation/difficulty) based similarity and trail descriptions (tags, short description, long description) based similarity. Feature standardization is used to account for the fact that trail stats had different scales and outliers, and difficulty rating (1-easy, 2-medium, 3-hard) were separated into dummy variables. For description based similarity matrix, NLP was used to create a bag of words, and TF-IDF was used to calculate similarity matrix.

The given input was 'Seven Falls Trail' located in Santa Barbara. It has distance of 3.2 miles, duration of 112 minutes, elevation of 843 fts, with difficulty level 2. The short description of the trail says

```Seven Falls Trail is a 3.2 mile heavily trafficked out and back trail located near Santa Barbara, California that features a waterfall and is rated as moderate. The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail.```

Using a trail stats based model, we see that recommended trails have trail stats very similar to that of the input trail. However, none of the trails feature waterfalls, which could be why the user liked Seen Falls trail. 

Next, using a text based model, 4 out of 5 recommendations feature water fall, but the trail stats are quite spread out from the input trail stats.

Lastly, by combining the trail stat and text based models, 3 out of 5 trails features waterfall and the trail stats are closer to the input trail compared to text based model. 

## Collaborative filtering based model

 

### Baseline Model
First, a baseline model is established by making random recommendations. 

### Content based recommendation
  Similarity matrix between trails were calculated. Then, based on the user input, 5 trails with highest similarity was recommended to the user. Three different content based models were established:
  1. Trail stats similarity : Features such as distance, elevation, difficulty were used to calculate similarity. Gives recommendations based on trails stats.
  2. Text based similarity: Used NLP to obtain TF-IDF matrix, which was then converted to trail-trail similarity. Gives recommendations based on description of the trails (i.e scenary, accessibility, activities, trail conditions, etc) 
  3. Hybrid similarity: Combination of stats and text based similarity. Gives recommendations based on both trail stats and description. 

### Collaboratie filtering based recommendation 
  Collaborative filtering based recommendation models were built that utilizes ratings given by users. By using the user ratings, more personnalized recommendations can be given. Two different collaborative filtering models were built to predict star rating for user-item pair, generate recommendation based on top 5 predicted ratings per user:
  1. Item-item based collaobratie filtering: As there were more number of users than number of trails, item-item based filtering (as opposed to user-user based)
  2. Matrix factorization: SVP was used to reduce dimensionality 
  
  
### Evaluation metrics
  The most idealistic way to test recommender models would be to deploy the model and test the user response through A/B testing. As conducting such test is not possible, the existing data (or part of data) can be used to assess and compare performance. 
  
  
  
### Web deployment:



## Future directions:
In order to improve the prediction accuracy, we could:  
- Use the incorrectly predicted images to further train our model  
- Add more images (through web scraping or data augmentation)  
- Increase the model complexity to better capture the non-linear decision boundary

Additionally, I'd like to:
- Use transfer learning and compare prediction accuracy
- Add additional cuisines and test performance
